Is there anyone who can help me?

18
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:02,000
Inazumax and Smileman are on their way.
Hurry up and set the disaster level!

Look! It's a huge explosion!

22
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:18,000
Damage caused by disaster victims continues to expand on an unprecedented scale.
At present, the level of disaster is being judged on the boundary side... (explosion sound)

(explosion)

37
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:14,000
You're a hobby hero. What is it?

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:24,000
The appropriate setting is
I am a vaccine man created by humans repeatedly polluting the environment!

39
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:31,867
The earth is a living organism.
You humans are nothing but pathogens that will continue to devour life on Earth.

40
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:41,000
To erase the human race and the foreign civilization it created.
I was made from the stones of the earth!

41
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,000
Is that a hobby?

42
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,000
A hobby?

43
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, (Explosion)

44
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:52,000
That's why it's human to oppose me!

46
00:02:54,125 --> 00:03:03,000
(explosion sound).

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,000
It's over with one pan again.

48
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,000
Damn it!

49
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:21,000
Music

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
One Bread!

51
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:28,000
Music

52
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,000
3,2,1, cunion!

53
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:35,000
It was the best battlefield victory in history!

54
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,000
Crushing

55
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,000
It won't stop!

56
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,000
One punch!

57
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,000
DONE!

58
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's Zero Let's Show!

59
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm Cass, Suzuki Cass!

60
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:49,000
Power Gets Power

61
00:03:49,001 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't want a voice or a cheer that honors me to the limit of my ability.
Hero, so I know how to fight evil! Faye! Faye!

62
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:28,000
I will not turn my back on an enemy who is pouring in empty weights.
A hero without clothes is a hero who fights accordingly.

63
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:34,000
The lonely hero.

64
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:39,000
I am the hero who fights.

65
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:44,000
Ahhh.

66
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:46,000
Pooh! Cookckckckckckkkkkkk!

67
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,000
Phantom! Run!

68
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you have to run away?

69
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,000
Puff, puff, puff, puff?

70
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:08,000
Pukupuku - a new salaryman who is tired of the company
I ate too many crabs and suddenly became a pervert.

71
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:17,000
You have to flee in front of Lord Canilante.
You want to die, don't you?

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
A different kind of hero, eh?

73
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,000
Hero, I'm not a salaryman, I'm unemployed.

74
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,000
And now I'm looking for a job.

75
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,000
I was interviewed today, but it was beautifully dropped. Why?

76
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,000
It doesn't matter what it is.

77
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:37,000
When Lord Canilante showed up.

78
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't feel like running away.

79
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,000
Pukukuku puku.

80
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,000
Should I run away?

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Pukuu

82
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:50,000
You're as blind as I am.

83
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,000
Yoshimi with dead eyes.

84
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going to let you know that I'm looking for another prey.

85
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,000
a shattered boy on the chin

86
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:09,000
When I find him, he's on his way.

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:24,000
What are you looking at, bastard?

88
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,000
If he finds it, he'll go first.

89
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey, kid, did you do anything to the crab monster?

90
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:32,000
What? 

91
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:41,000
I slept in the park, so I magically painted my nipples.
This is him, this kid. He doesn't know what he's done.

92
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,000
What do we do? Not yet?

93
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:52,000
But it's not cute. This has nothing to do with me.

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Oh, I see. What are you doing?

95
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,000
What? 

96
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,000
The kid's after you. Get out of here.

97
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:13,000
What? 

98
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't worry about me. Get out of here.

99
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,000
But a football is a ball.

100
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,000
Kuku

101
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:27,000
What the hell are you doing?

102
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

103
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:34,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

104
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:45,000
Think about it, you fucker. I've already cut some of them.
Whoever made a fool of this figure is not leaking.

105
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:57,000
By the way, that kid just fired my body.
And it's oily. I can't even wipe it with a towel.

106
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:04,000
If you disturb me, I'll make you a body you won't be able to harvest for the rest of your life.

107
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,000
Hahahakuku

108
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,000
I remembered something. You look just like the anime villain you used to see.

109
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,000
Kuku

110
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:29,000
Die, oh, oh, oh?

111
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Yeah, I wanted to be a hero when I was a kid.

112
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm not a salaryman.
He's a hero who can blow a villain like Teme with a single blow.

113
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't stop harvesting. Come on. Come on.

114
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:09,000
You're a hero, you fallen, you're insane. Die here.

115
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
Kuku

116
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:13,000
Kuku

117
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:41,000
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Looks like it's been three years since then.

118
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:50,000
Ever since then, I've been training so hard that I'm so excited.

119
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,000
I've gained unstoppable power.

120
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:09,000
I wanted to be a hero, but why?
There's something wrong with me. Why am I so unfulfilled? 482 yen. Yes.

121
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, wait a minute.

122
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:21,000
It is 82 yen.

123
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:58,000
That's amazing, brother. I can't believe this is so far.
Oh, more than I can imagine, brother.

124
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:10,000
I wanted to be the strongest man in the world.
The strongest man, that's my dream.

125
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,000
The Ultimate Steroid at Last

126
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:21,000
Joe Mann, the King of Two Swords is finished.
Brother, if you drink this, you'll have the power you've always wanted.

127
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you want to drink this?

128
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, I made it strawberry-flavored so it's easy to drink, bro.

129
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:45,457
You can do this with my brain and your muscles.
I wanted the best strength and the strongest body.

130
00:11:45,469 --> 00:12:03,000
If our brothers and sisters join forces,
You can conquer everything on earth and be king. That's great, brother.

131
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:24,000
Tens of thousands of people are dead. All right, keep cleaning up the town next door.
This is the most powerful force I've ever sought, the emergency evacuation tendency. A giant creature has emerged in the city of D.

132
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:37,407
A giant creature is approaching City B.
Emergency evacuation. Repeat, City D.

133
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, let me show you. I'm the strongest man.
What do you think, brother? You're the strongest man I've ever known.

134
00:12:55,001 --> 00:13:01,000
Put on your pants and kill the guy on your shoulder.

135
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Brother, how did this happen? I was just looking for strength.
I've finally become the strongest man.

136
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:33,000
Look, I don't know who you are, but you killed my brother.

137
00:13:34,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is the strength of our brothers, I am the strongest, I am the strongest, I am the strongest.

138
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:17,000
That's why it's empty.

139
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,000
- We're not low.

140
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Automatic power is boring.

141
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The evil in the world never seems to go away.

142
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,000
This is the same as before I started Hero.

143
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,000
I mean, I don't have any influence on society.

144
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm not sad about that.

145
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:21,000
But every day I'm in trouble, my emotions fade away.

146
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,000
I no longer felt fear, tension, joy, or anger.

147
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Have you lost something important in exchange for power?

148
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:59,000
Previously, there were various emotions swirling in the battle.
If you want to disturb your anger, put on your proud headlights.

149
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,000
Roll lamp

150
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:09,000
Now it's done in one pan.

151
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,000
Eggs for dinner tonight.

152
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:24,000
Days to wash gloves back home unscathed.

153
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,000
When fighting monsters and monsters.
There's no soul bumping in there.

154
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm just a hero as a hobby.

155
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:43,000
I mean, if you're satisfied with yourself, that's fine, my blood!

156
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
My blood!

157
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,000
My blood!

158
00:16:51,700 --> 00:17:10,000
My blood!

159
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,000
My blood!

00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:23,000
What the hell, guys?

162
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:30,000
It's rude of you to say that we're real Earthlings, aren't we?

163
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,000
You call us subterraneans.

164
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:44,624
We decided to take the ground because the numbers were too high.
But it seems that there are quite a lot of people on the ground.

165
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:53,000
You're going to get in our way.
That's why I'm asking you to go extinct.

166
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Seventy percent of the Grounders have returned to Earth since we began our invasion.
This is also a survival competition. I want you to accept it.

167
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I was surprised, though. I'm the first man on the face of the earth to beat him up and never die.
It's the same here. It's been a long time since I've seen such a resilient phantom.

168
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,000
Underground People

169
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,000
We are Earthlings!

170
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:33,000
What, what!?

171
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,000
Don't fuck with me!

172
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:41,000
ACE SPECK:

173
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Damn!

174
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,000
Damn!

175
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,000
Damn!

176
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,000
Damn!

177
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:52,000
Damn!

178
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,000
Damn it. We're cooked.

179
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Damn!

180
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Damn!

181
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Damn!

182
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,000
Damn!

183
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:34,000
You're done. - What?

184
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Who the hell was that man on the ground?

185
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm a hobby hero.
I won't lose, I'll protect the ground!

186
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:55,000
Sasake! Weak race!

187
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Damn!

188
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, my God, this feeling is the sound of this heartbeat.
This pinch, this tension.

189
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The excitement of this fight!

190
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah, I lost, I remember this!

191
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh, my God, my sons are taking such good care of you!

192
00:20:56,001 --> 00:21:03,000
This Underground King will take care of you. This is it!

193
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:06,000
Sasaki!

194
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,000
Sasaki!

195
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Sasaki!

196
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,000
&#13;

197
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,000
What I was looking for!

198
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:32,000
I got it on the ground!

199
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,000
The people on the ground will die!

200
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:40,000
I am the Underground King! Prepare the ground people!

201
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:48,000
Come on, let's do it!

202
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,000
I became too strong.

203
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,000
(explosion sound).

204
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,000
Music

205
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey, come home early. Sighs shake the crescent moon.
Close your eyes and think about you.

206
00:22:37,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I want to see you, I want to cry, I want to feel romantic.
I've always known this thought, and I've tried so hard.

207
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:40,000
The people I love are strong, and they're worried about me, but they're weak.
I'll find you before the stars. Come back soon, come back soon (music).

208
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Music

209
00:23:51,850 --> 00:24:02,000
Boo, boo, boo!

210
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,000
How did it go with me this week?

211
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:08,000
It's time for me, Miss Canilante, to tell you about next week!

212
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:10,000
So, uh, no footage?

213
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:13,000
Well, next week a man will appear in Z, where Saitama lives!

214
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,000
What?

215
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:19,000
Hmm? I don't have time.
Well, for the time being, the next one-pan-man episode 2 "Lonely Cyborg"

216
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,000
Next week, everyone... well, next week.
