Code Analysis

Main functionalities:
The AudioExtraction class provides a simple interface for extracting audio from video files using ffmpeg. It takes the input video file path and output audio file path as arguments and provides a method to extract the audio track from the video file. It also handles exceptions that may occur during the extraction process.

Methods:
- __init__(self, input_video_file_path: str, output_audio_file_path: str) -> None: Initializes the class with the input video file path and output audio file path.
- extract_audio(self) -> None: Extracts the audio track from the video file using ffmpeg. It first checks the available audio tracks in the video file and prompts the user to choose a language. It then maps the chosen language to a track number and extracts the audio track using ffmpeg. It also handles exceptions that may occur during the extraction process.

Fields:
- input_video_file_path: str: Path of input video file.
- output_audio_file_path: str: Path of output audio file.
